## Advices
   - Steps for great software:
     1. Make sure that the software makes what the customer wants
     2. Apply basic OOP principles to add flexibility
     3. use design patterns
   - Don't create a problem to solve the problem
   - String is bad when comparing
     - You can use constants or Enums instead
     - Best using enums
   - No problem if you do some design in making the software work
   - Trying to do too much design before youâ€™ve at least got the basic functionality down can end up being a waste
   - Class should be:
     - the name of the class should express it
     - the class has specific responsibility
     - Unused properties indicate that the class do more than one job (so you have to think again about the class)
   - Encapsulate what varies
     - this protects from repeated code
   - delegate some methods to achieve loosely coupled
